The Apache Hive data warehouse software facilitates reading, writing, ans managing large datasets residubg ub dustributed and queried using SQL syntax.

CAN:Built on the top of Apache Hadoop, Hive provides the following features:
  1. Tools to enable easy access to data via SQL, thus enabling data warehousing tasks such as extract/transform/load(ETL), reporting ans data analysis.
  2. A mechanism to impose structure on a varity of data formats.
  3. Access to files stored either directly in Apache HDFS or in the data storage systems such as Apache HBase.
  4. Query execution via Apache Tez, Aoache Spark, or MapReduce.
  5. Procedural language with HPL-SQL.
  6. Sub-second query retrieval via Hive LLAP, Apache YARN and Apache Slider.
CAN/CANNOT: Hive is not designed for online transaction processing, It is best used for traditional data warehousing tasks.
  
Components of Hive include HCatalog and WebHCat.
  1. HCatalog is a component of Hive, It is table and storage management layer for Hadoop that enables users with different data processing tools--including Pig and MapReduce--to more easily read and write data on the grid.
  2. WebHCat provides a service that you can use to run Hadoop MapReduce (or YARN), Pig, Hive jobs or perform Hive metadata operations using an HTTP interface.
