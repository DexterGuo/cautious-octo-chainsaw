Transform/Map-Reduce Syntax

Users can also plug in their own custom mappers and reducers in the data stream by using features natively supported in the Hive language.
e.g. in order to run a custom mapper script-map_script and a custom reducer script-reduce_script te user can issue the following command which 
uses the TRANSFORM clause to embed the mapper and the reducer scripts.

By default, columns will be  transform to STRING and delimited by TAB before feeding to the user script; similarity, all NULL values will be
converted to the literal string \N in order to differentiate NULL values from empty strings. the standard output of the user script will be 
treated as TAB-separated STRING columns, any cell containing only \N will be re-interpreted as a NULL, and then the resulting STRING column will
be cast to the data type specified in the table declaration in the usual way. User script can output debug information to standard error which
will be shown on the task detail page on hadoop. these defaults can be overriden with ROW FORMAT.
